  This JS script, which injects a donation form, is a good alternative if you don't want to receive anymore monthly bills for unpayed processing fees.

### What it does

- It's free to use, no Donorbox processing fee, no more monthly bills to pay.
- It uses a free [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/) channel to receive notifications about new donations.
  - This is how and where the form data is saved: amount, comment and donor info.
  - If you have access to a backend, use Paypal `notify_url` (POST) or `return` (GET/POST) [url param](https://github.com/jwallet/donate/blob/master/src/actions/paypal.js#L11:L28).

### What it doesn't

- It doesn't send email... yet.
- It doesn't keep track of all donations.
- It doesn't do recurring donation, only one-time donation.

> `*` [Donorbox]("https://donorbox.org/") is a fundraising webapp that adds 1.5% of processing fees on top of your donations for providing a small form that links to Paypal and for keeping tracks of past donations with access to a dashboard and email notifications.
